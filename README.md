# 👋 Hi, I’m Adam Jaspan.

I've decided to make the transition over to GitHub, so forgive me if this area is a little empty for now!

You can find my GitLab [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/ajaspan) if youre interested (although it's mostly all private i'm afraid 😅)

## Abount me: 

I'm interested in Data Science, and particularly in fun, interesting applications of machine learning!

I’m currently looking to get my first job in DS, having come to the end of my PhD in particle-physics. 

During this PhD, I worked on data analysis with the full ATLAS Run II data set, concisting of around 1 × 10¹⁶ proton-proton collisions, so some seriously "Big Data"!!

## 📫 How to reach me 

If you want to find out more about my work, please shoot me a message over on my [Linkedin!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-jaspan/) or you can email me at <adam.jaspan@googlemail.com>
